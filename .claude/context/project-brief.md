# GPU Cloth Simulation - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A high-performance, GPU-accelerated cloth simulator built in Rust using modern compute shaders and real-time rendering techniques.

## Core Objectives
- **Performance**: Achieve 60+ FPS cloth simulation with thousands of particles
- **Accuracy**: Implement XPBD (Extended Position-Based Dynamics) for stable, realistic cloth behavior
- **Interactivity**: Provide real-time parameter adjustment and user interaction
- **Modularity**: Design clean, extensible architecture for future enhancements

## Key Technical Goals
1. **GPU-First Architecture**: All physics computation on GPU via compute shaders
2. **Modern Rust**: Leverage Rust's safety and performance for host-side coordination
3. **Cross-Platform**: Built on wgpu for broad hardware and OS compatibility
4. **Real-Time Rendering**: Direct GPU buffer usage for zero-copy visualization

## Success Metrics
- Stable simulation of 50x50 particle cloth grid at 60 FPS
