# Task 001: GPU Buffer Management System

**Epic:** CLOTH-001  
**Milestone:** 1 - Foundation  
**Effort:** 2 days (5 story points)  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Parallelizable:** No - Foundation requirement  

## Overview

Implement the core GPU buffer management system using Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) layout for optimal GPU memory access patterns. This system will manage all persistent GPU storage for cloth simulation data.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Persistent GPU buffer allocation with proper cleanup
- Structure-of-Arrays memory layout for coalesced access
- Double-buffering system for read/write operations where needed
- Memory synchronization without CPU stalls

### Buffer Types Required
```rust
struct PhysicsBuffers {
    positions: Buffer<Vec4>,      // xyz + mass (w component)
    velocities: Buffer<Vec4>,     // xyz + damping (w component)  
    old_positions: Buffer<Vec4>,  // Previous positions for XPBD integration
    constraints: Buffer<Constraint>, // Constraint data
    constraint_indices: Buffer<u32>, // Particle index pairs
    forces: Buffer<Vec4>,         // Accumulated forces
    debug_info: Buffer<DebugData>, // Runtime debugging data
}
```

### Memory Layout Specification
- **Alignment**: 16-byte aligned for Vec4 data types
- **Access Pattern**: Optimize for GPU coalesced memory access
- **Size Management**: Dynamic sizing based on cloth resolution
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource deallocation on drop

## Implementation Details

### Buffer Creation
- Use wgpu::Buffer::create with appropriate usage flags
- STORAGE usage for compute shader access
- COPY_DST for initial data upload
- COPY_SRC for debug readback (optional)

### Memory Management
```rust
pub struct BufferManager {
    device: Arc<wgpu::Device>,
    position_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    velocity_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    // ... other buffers
}

impl BufferManager {
    pub fn new(device: Arc<wgpu::Device>, particle_count: u32) -> Self;
    pub fn resize(&mut self, new_particle_count: u32);
    pub fn cleanup(&mut self);
}
```

### Synchronization Strategy
- Use wgpu::Device::poll for command completion
- Implement buffer barriers where needed
- Avoid CPU-GPU synchronization during simulation loop

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Buffer Allocation**: Successfully create all required GPU buffers for 32x32 cloth grid (1024 particles)
- [ ] **Memory Layout**: Verify Structure-of-Arrays layout provides expected memory access patterns
- [ ] **Resource Management**: No memory leaks during buffer creation/destruction cycles
- [ ] **Size Scaling**: Support dynamic resizing from 1K to 50K particles
- [ ] **Performance**: Buffer operations complete within 1ms on target hardware
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of GPU memory allocation failures

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Rust project initialized with wgpu dependencies
- Basic wgpu device/queue initialization
- Target hardware with compute shader support

### Blocks
- Task 002 (Basic XPBD Physics Pipeline) - requires buffer system
- Task 003 (Minimal Rendering Pipeline) - requires position buffers
- Task 004 (Application Framework) - requires buffer size configuration

### Can Work In Parallel With
- Task 005 (Shader Architecture Setup) - different code areas

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```rust
#[test]
fn buffer_creation_and_cleanup() {
    // Test buffer allocation and proper cleanup
}

#[test] 
fn buffer_resizing() {
    // Test dynamic buffer resizing
}

#[test]
fn memory_layout_validation() {
    // Validate SoA memory layout
}
```

### Integration Tests
- Memory usage profiling during extended operation
- Buffer synchronization under stress
- Cross-platform buffer behavior validation

## Performance Targets

- **Memory Allocation**: <10ms for initial buffer creation
- **Resize Operations**: <5ms for 2x size increase
- **Memory Usage**: Linear scaling with particle count
- **GPU Memory**: Efficient utilization >80% of allocated space

## Risk Factors

- **GPU Memory Limits**: Large particle counts may exceed VRAM
- **Platform Differences**: Buffer behavior across D3D12/Vulkan/Metal
- **Memory Alignment**: Incorrect alignment causing performance issues

## Notes

- This is the foundation task - all other GPU-related tasks depend on this
- Focus on correctness first, optimization can be addressed in later milestones
- Extensive error handling needed for graceful degradation on low-memory systems
